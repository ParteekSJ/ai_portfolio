In this project, we've applied the Masked Multi-scale Reconstruction (MMR) method which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02216v2) on the Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset.  This model utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) based encoder-decoder architecture and Feature Pyramid Network to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to perform multi-scale reconstruction of image patches. The architecture looks as follows:

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/ParteekSJ/Masked-Multiscale-Reconstruction). Below are the outputs of the trained model on the AeBAD dataset.
