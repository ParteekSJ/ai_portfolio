In this project, we've implemented and fine-tuned YOLOv9 on a custom dataset, significantly enhancing accuracy in player and tennis ball detection. Additionlly, we've designed and developed a custom TrackNet-inspired architecture for precise tennis court keypoint detection from broadcast footage. Lastly, we've also integrated sophisticated algorithms to calculate and analyze player movement speed and shot velocity, providing valuable insights for performance evaluation. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/ParteekSJ/tennis-player-ball-tracking-with-analysis).
